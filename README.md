# Ensemble Adversarial Black-Box Attacks against Deep Learning Systems
We design a novel ensemble-based approach to craft adversarial samples with stronger transferability than conventional gradient-based single substitute approaches, such as FGS, I-FGS, RAND_FGS. We make a comparison to these approaches.
